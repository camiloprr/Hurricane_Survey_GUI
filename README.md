This project serves as the culmination of our programming course and focuses on developing a survey for individuals impacted by hurricanes in Southwest Florida. Our goal is to eventually implement this survey in a real-world setting, allowing participants to contribute valuable data. By analyzing the responses, we aim to gain deeper insights into the effects of these natural disasters and better understand their impact on affected communities.v
